title: Tabular figures on numbers read alone
kind: missing
status: done

source: the Layers panel, editor redesign at f608871 (held-out finding layers-15, rated real)
skill: [references/typography.md]
sections: [layers]

**What happened.** PageSize uses tabular-nums in Onest, so the narrow 1 gets a full figure width and "1100"/"1440" read like "1 100"/"1 440".

**How it was found.** A fresh reviewer per section, in `recall-redesign-1`, on a section no gap
named: shipped skill 1/2, redesign-gaps 0/2. The person rated it real
(`decisions/held-out-rest`, layers-15). Theme: type.

**The skill now.** `typography.md` covers styles, sizes, weights, truncation ("A name or a title in a dense row truncates to one line") and field labels. It doesn't name names in a list (they read first), tabular figures, or an edit field that must keep the text where it was.

**Proposed.** In `typography.md`'s table: "Names in a list in the body weight, as heavy as their metadata → the label style"; "Tabular figures in a face whose 1 is narrow, on numbers read alone (a size, a date) → proportional; tabular only in columns to compare"; "An inline edit that moves the text or changes its weight → the field takes the text's style and place"; "A truncating name that can't shrink → it truncates, its metadata gives way first".

**Test.** Recall on `layers`, shipped against the candidate `held-out-themes`, 2 runs.

**Result.**

- `held-out-1`: 2026-11-04, caught: shipped 0/2 (+1 partly), held-out-themes 2/2, held-out-plain 2/2 (opus, effort high; runs/held-out-1/report.md)
- Decision of 2026-11-04 (made by the agent, as the person asked: ship wording where the candidate catches more with no more noise; `held-out-1`, runs/held-out-1/report.md): closed by the row the candidate `held-out-themes` added to the check table, shipped with the gap's number in its commit. The same row in general words (`held-out-plain`) caught it less often or not at all; the example in the row is what the reviewer recognises.
